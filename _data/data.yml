    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Over the past years, I've primarily focused on the technical aspects of testing.
      This includes gaining a comprehensive understanding of how different parts of the software work together
      to design the most effective test automation solutions based on best practices.
      I love discussing the technical aspects of a problem and searching for the best solutions with my colleagues,
      and I greatly appreciate the opportunity to learn from them. 
      Although I'm almost never the smartest person in the room,
      my easy-going and friendly personality helps me better communicate and understand the team's needs.
      However, frankly speaking, it's not an easy job at times.
